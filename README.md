> "Vision sees everything."

A privacy-first, open-source autonomous developer OS built by
[Arshveen Singh](https://github.com/Arshveen-singh). 
The ground-up rebuild of Vision CLI v1.4.4 — done right this time.
Modular. Portable. Self-evolving. Inspired by Claude Mythos and
Project Glasswing.

---

## What's new in v2.0?

v1.4.4 was a proof of concept. v2.0 is the real thing.

- Proper modular architecture (not one giant file)
- Shadow sandbox — Docker execution, you see only success
- Obsidian vault memory — Vision's brain lives in your notes
- Multi-agent debate — two AIs argue until code is bulletproof
- Telegram approval gateway — approve risky actions from phone
- Claude Code style TUI with pixel cat mascot =^.^=
- Hybrid routing across 17 providers — free tier first, always
- Runs fully portable from a USB drive
- Zero cloud dependency for memory and skills

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arshveen-singh/Vision-CLI
cd Vision-CLI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py start
```

First run → setup screen asks for API keys  
Then → model selector → boot sequence → Vision is live

## Core Features

### =^.^= Vibe Check TUI
Claude Code style terminal interface. Pure ANSI,
no heavy frameworks. Pixel cat mascot reacts to
every state. Feels alive.

### 🧠 Neural Vault Memory
Vision's memory lives in your Obsidian vault as
plain markdown files. Read it. Edit it. Delete it.
Full transparency, zero cloud.

### 🐳 Shadow Sandbox
Every risky command runs in a Docker container
first. You only see successful results applied
to your real filesystem. Never breaks anything.

### ⚔ Multi-Agent Debate
/debate <your code>
→ Builder:  writes clean implementation
→ Critic:   attacks security + edge cases
→ Round 2:  Builder defends + fixes
→ Verdict:  improved code + full debate log

### 📱 Telegram Gateway
Every risky action sends an approval request to
your phone. Approve or reject from anywhere.
Vision waits. Asynchronously.

### 🔀 Hybrid Model Router
Simple tasks → fast free model (Groq/Cerebras)  
Complex tasks → smart model (DeepSeek R1/Kimi K2)  
Target: 90% cost reduction vs always using big models

### 🐚 Natural Language Shell

show me all python files modified today
Vision suggests: find . -name "*.py" -mtime -1
Run it? (y/n)

## Contributing

Adding a provider = 15 lines.  
Adding a skill = one YAML file.  
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Inspiration

Inspired by Claude's Mythos persona and Anthropic's
Project Glasswing — the belief that powerful AI
tooling should belong to every developer, not just
40-partner consortiums with $100M budgets.
